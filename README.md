# sp-template
Science project template
## Introduction
## Requirements
Create a means of bypassing the need to fill in forms.
Make sure that the form data reaches the correct function.
Replace the data recieved from the form with arrays.

Use a better means of updating the page than jQuery
Research this today. Create a test page.

Make sure the application can be developed locally and pushed to the remote location. Use a code management tool for this like git. You need the system to make a note of which files you've changed etc, so that you don't have to keep a track.

You need to be able to work in a similar way to liveStyle, but with all code changes (e.g HTML), so that you don't have to keep refreshing the browser. This will require a combination of tools in the setup such as this JavaScipt framework and that Atom package. Create new template which allows for this setup to work.
## Lessons learned
You didn't load the data from the files in the correct order. This turned out to be more important later on. Absolutely nail each task before moving on to the next.

Remove all errors from the console as you build.
